# Visualizing-Nobel-Prize-Winners
This project explores patterns and trends over 100 years worth of nobel prize winners, through data manipualtion and data visualization using Python (Pandas, Seaborn). <br>

The key objectives of the analysis are to ascertain which country has historically had the maximum number of Nobel Prize winners (spoiler alert: it's the USA!), whether there is any gender disparity in prize winners, age differences between prize categories and so on. The analysis also experiments with the Seaborn library and line plots are used to observe patterns and trends for several variables.
